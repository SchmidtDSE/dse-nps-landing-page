title: On-the-fly Derived Fire Boundaries - June 2024
type: docs
weight: 4

The tool has been updated with an improved methodology to derive fire boundaries using only approximate areas of interest. You can find more information on how to use this new feature on the [How To](/about/how_to/) page.

As of now, there is no significant post-processing performed on derived boundaries - however, within the next few weeks, we plan to implement a more robust methodology to remove artifacts from these boundaries.
