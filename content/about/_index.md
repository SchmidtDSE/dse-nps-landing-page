This is a very early development prototype of a _Wildfire Severity and Recovery Tool_, devloped by Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center for Data Science & Environment (DSE) at Berkeley in collaboration with the National Parks Service, meant to gather feedback from interested collaborators and users.

The core of this collaboration comes from a need to better understand the severity of fires occuring in low biomass areas - in our initial case, in Southern California (specifically, Joshua Tree National Park and Mojave National Preserve).

This tool uses publicly available satellite imagery (currently, the European Space Agency's _Sentinel 2_ imagery) to estimate fire severity metrics on-demand.
