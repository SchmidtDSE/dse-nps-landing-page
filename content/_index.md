NPS park managers confronting ecosystem vulnerability in a changing climate must navigate academic literature, expert opinion, inventory and monitoring data, research results, and public input when making decisions regarding vegetation management - especially post-fire or after other large-scale disturbances.

This toolbox synthesizes these information sources to support managers in making resource-efficient decisions regarding post-disturbance vegetation management:

- **Assess disturbance severity** from satellite imagery, with metrics calibrated for low-biomass environments
- **Project vegetation recovery** under different climate and management scenarios using process-based simulation
- **Compare intervention strategies** under real-world constraints like seed availability, labor, and budget
