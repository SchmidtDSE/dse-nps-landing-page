{{< callout type="info" >}}
This tool is currently in development. We plan to use the [<span class="josh">josh</span> simulation engine](https://joshsim.org) to perform resource optimization analyses. Integration approaches are under development in the [<span class="josh">josh</span>-toolbox-demo](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/josh-toolbox-demo) repository.

## Planned Workflow

*Detailed how-to documentation will be developed as the tool matures.*

The planned workflow for Resource Optimization:

1. **Define constraints**  -  specify seed availability, labor hours, budget, and logistical requirements
2. **Configure candidate strategies**  -  select combinations of interventions to compare
3. **Run simulations**  -  the tool will drive [Vegetation Modeling](/tools/vegetation-modeling) to simulate each strategy
4. **Compare outcomes**  -  review side-by-side results to evaluate tradeoffs
